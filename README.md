# CPTS415_G6
  
  This repo contains the code base for CPTS 415 Big Data Final Project
  
  Our Project is based off of creating an Airline Search Engine which has also been outfitted to showcase scalability of algorithms used, using mock datasets. The Project is comprised of teo pieces: sequential algoriths and distributed algorithms.
  
  The Sequential Algorithm is written in Python 3.6. The Distributed Algorithm is coded in Scala and designed to work within a AWS linux environment running a Spark instance.
